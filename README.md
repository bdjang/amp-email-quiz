# AMP Email Quiz Template

## Background

Many news organizations create quizzes about major events that happened during the week. These organizations usually send out an email to their subscribers containing a link to the quiz hosted on their website.

I thought it would be interesting to try building the weekly news quiz completely inside the email using AMP.

To view the AMP emails, go to the [Gmail AMP for Email Playground](https://amp.gmail.dev/playground/) and paste in the template code.

Both versions of the AMP quiz template are very similar. The only difference is that `amp-quiz-template-colorcoded.html` uses `AMP.setState` to display the quiz results with color.
